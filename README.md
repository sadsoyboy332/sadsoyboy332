 👋 Hi, I am James King
- 👀 I’m very energetic and young, I can cope with any task⚡
- Now I am studying programming and have already perfected python, but I will not stop at just 1 language💲
- I like to watch other developers think, because programming is a creative business and every programmer has a different approach to accomplishing 1 and the same task😎🎨
